        Well, it's been almost one week since I finished up the first module at Turing, and I've had some time to reflect on how much I've learned in such a short span of time - seriously, it's a lot, and it's crazy. But the <i>craziest</i> part is, we've only just scratched the surface and I absolutely cannot wait to dive right back in. The workload can be quite a handful at times, but as I've often told my friends and family back home, I'm always enjoying what I'm doing to a large extent. Honestly, it doesn't seem like work. It seems more like solving exciting, challenging puzzles and my thirst for learning is constantly being quenched. On top of all that, the community at Turing is fantastic, and my cohort offers so much support to one another that I'm never afraid to seek out help or offer my advice in return.<br><br>So far we've gotten a handle on Ruby, and although I'm no master of the language, I particularly enjoy its readability and clean style - it definitely makes jumping in to help someone else's code just that much easier when it reads somewhat like written english. I still have yet to get a firm grasp on Git and GitHub, though I'm making strides. I know I'll get there, it just takes repetition.<br><br>Repetition. This is actually something that Turing is constantly drilling into its students - the idea of having a "growth mindset" as an approach to learning. They stress to ALL students that yes, you WILL learn this stuff. Just stay positive, put in your reps, and work hard...success will most assuredly follow. I've internalized this "growth mindset" mantra and constantly remind myself of it when I'm stuggling (which happens to everyone at Turing at some point).<br><br>Technically, I've enjoyed "de-mystifying" what's going on under the hood of my computer, the internet, and programming in general, and look forward to continuing this process in the coming modules. I'm starting to feel comfortable with my editor (shout-out to Atom) and I think I'm most looking forward to learning the Rails framework in module 2. It should be pretty exciting to see our ideas start to approach actual fucntioning web applications. Stay tuned for updates throughout the next mod!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Craig
